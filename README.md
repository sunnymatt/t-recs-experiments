# Getting started
Welcome! You have arrived at the repository that accompanies "T-RECS: A Simulation Tool to Study the Societal Impact of Recommender Systems." Here, we apply the (T-RECS)[https://github.com/elucherini/t-recs/] library to replicate two prior studies and perform one novel extension. Within each folder you will find more details about the particular study that is replicated and how to run the code. Please check each file you intend to run for any packages that you will need to install before running.

To find code related to the replication of "How Algorithmic Confounding in Recommendation Systems Increases Homogeneity and Decreases Utility" (Chaney et al. 2018) or the content creator experiments in "T-RECS: A Simulation Tool to Study the Societal Impact of Recommender Systems," please look at the `algo_confounding` folder.

To find code related to the replication of "The Structural Virality of Online Diffusion" (Goel et al. 2016), please look at the `structural_virality` folder.
