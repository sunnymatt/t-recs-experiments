# Getting started
Welcome! You have arrived at the repository that accompanies "T-RECS: A Simulation Tool to Study the Societal Impact of Recommender Systems." Here, we apply the (T-RECS)[https://github.com/elucherini/t-recs/] library to replicate two prior studies and perform one novel extension. Within each folder you will find more details about the particular study that is replicated and how to run the code. Please check each file you intend to run for any packages that you will need to install before running.
